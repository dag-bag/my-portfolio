This is a Next.js project used to generate Open Graph (OG) images with customizable parameters, such as title, URL, avatar, author, and date. The project uses [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) to format dates and the `useSearchParams` hook from `next/navigation` to retrieve parameters from the URL query string. The generated OG images have a fixed width and height of 1200x630 pixels and feature a gradient background. The default domain is `honghong.me`, and the generated OG images display the author's avatar, name, title, and publishing date.
