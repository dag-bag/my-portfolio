## üîî Notice: Please Do Not Use This Source Code as a Template

Hello there! Thank you for checking out my open-source project. I've created this project to share my work and inspire others to create great things. However, I've noticed that some people are using my source code as a template for their websites, which is not what I intended.

While I'm happy to share my code with the community, I would like to request that you do not use this source code as a template for your website. Here are a few reasons why:

- **Lack of Originality:** Using someone else's source code as a template can result in a lack of originality in your work. It's important to create something unique and original that reflects your vision.
- **Lack of Learning:** Using someone else's source code as a template may prevent you from learning new skills and techniques. It's important to challenge yourself and learn new things to grow as a developer.

I hope you understand my request and appreciate the spirit in which this project was created. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding and happy coding!
